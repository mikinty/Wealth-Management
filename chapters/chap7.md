# An Example Portfolio

To give you an example of how you can utilize all these wealth management techniques, check this out.

Let's say I have $100,000 of money a year to put somewhere. This is after taxes and covering expenses like rent, food.

Also disclaimer this is just for illustrative purposes, don't just blindly follow these examples. It's also important to remind yourself that economic conditions may be very different for you when you reach certain ages. For example, if the savings and CD rates are essentially 0, maybe it's not worth putting any money in those categories.
