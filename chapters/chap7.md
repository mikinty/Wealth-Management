Let's say I have $100,000 of money a year to put somewhere.
This is after taxes and covering expenses like rent, food.
Then I will spread my money the following way: (have one for different ages)

| Asset   | Amount  |
|---|---|
| Savings  | $5,000  |
| CD       | $5,000 |
| ROTH IRA | $5,000* |
| 401k     | $10,000** |
| Index Funds | $15,000 |
| Stocks   | $50,000 |
| Gambling | $10,000 |

### Notes
\* I would contribute the max possible

\** I would contribute as much as my company is willing to match
