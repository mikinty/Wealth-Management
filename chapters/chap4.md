# Gambling

This is the danger zone. Be ready to lose lots of money, and in the slight chance you make it out alive, you can become very rich, very fast.

## Daytrading

Many times, I hear people say "only if I sold a few hours ago, I would have made a lot of profit!"
Daytrading is difficult because people are greedy, and on top of that, it's just generally hard to know when to buy or sell an asset. Because the market is somewhat a random process, timing tops and bottoms of a market is practically impossible.

## Options

While buying options is like playing at a casino, selling options is like being the casino.

## Forex

High volume, high leverage, short time.

## Cryptocurrencies

Bitcoin and Ethereum are pretty much the only cryptocurrencies you should be "investing" in, unless you have a strong reason to buy another coin. There are many useless altcoins, or even sh*tcoins as they are called, that are worth absolutely nothing, except that they might moon for no reason...you can try to catch these coins, but you'll end up on the wrong end 99.99% of the time.

Crypto is an asset, so there are also derivatives markets, like options. People also like to play with leveraged longs and shorts, with degens playing with 100x.

Recently there is decentralized finance, or DeFi, where you can lend your cryptocurrency to others for an interest charge. YFI is the leading protocol for this, and has been pretty successful, despite some very rocky beginnings. There is still a lot of risk in this sector though, because you can get liquidated if prices fluctuate against your position.
