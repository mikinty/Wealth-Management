# Medium Risk

In this category, we look at assets that can have frequent fluctuations in evaluation, but that net decent gains -- around 5-10% a  year.

## Real Estate

(This is something I need to do research on.)

The general idea is that if you can pay down-payment on a house to get a reasonable mortgage rate, instead of paying for rent, you can just pay the mortgage every month, and not only are you getting a place to live, but your mortgage goes towards the house, rather than just being taken by your landlord. It's important to remember that while this sounds great, mortgage is a commitment, and it isn't always worth it depending on where you are. For example, cities like NYC often have condo fees, city tax, and other various additional costs on top of mortage that actually make it difficult to even break even with mortgage, and thus make rent more feasible.

If you choose a decent location, you should expect real estate to give you a few percent of returns every year.

## Stocks

There are so many stocks out there that you can't really give advice for what stocks to choose. There are so many scammy ads online and articles that offer subscription services or special lists that are "bound to perform well." Cut the crap and do your own research. The best rule of thumb is to choose stocks you like and believe in, and just hold them for a very long time. Unless you have a strong reason to sell, you should probably just wait it out and truly invest in the company you own stock of.
