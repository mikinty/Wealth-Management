# Low Risk

A step up from free money, we take a look at some options that can potentially earn you some more money, but can make you feel upset at times, e.g. when the market is taking a downturn.

## 401k

You usually need an employer to open a 401k, but this is another retirement account you can have. A benefit of a 401k is that you can contribute to it _pre-tax_, meaning that you can contribute money to it from your paycheck before you pay taxes, which can be a huge benefit to anyone, as taxes for even the lowest income bracket is pretty high. However, you do have to eventually pay taxes on your 401k, which you do when you cash out. You also have to pay a penalty of 10% if you cash out before you reach retirement age, which is currently 65, but otherwise, you're just paying income tax on your 401k account that you take out. For most people, the limit to contribute to a 401k is 19.5k a year, but there are technically backdoor strategies where you can contribute much more, but I'm not going to over them for now...

## Broad Market Mutual and Index Funds

SP500, Dow Jones, NASDAQ -- these are household names for indexes that track larger parts of the market. These are generally safe, because as a whole, the market has much less variance than one sector. Also, the American market is doing pretty well, so it's generally a safe bet to hold American stocks long term.

See below for the most common tickers traded for the common American market indices:

| Index | Ticker |
| --- | --- |
| Dow Jones | DIA |
| SP500 | SPY |
| NASDAQ | QQQ |
