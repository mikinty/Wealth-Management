# Free Money

One of my favorite terms -- it's very misleading since things that are too good to be true should be avoided, but this chapter is about ways you can get money for sure without doing anything risky.

## Savings Account

What's the savings rate on your bank account? If it's something like 0.01%, then you're doing it wrong. This [link](https://www.creditkarma.com/advice/i/high-yield-savings-accounts/) should give an idea of what type of rates you should be looking for at the very least. You can find a good selection of high yield savings accounts through a simple Google search.

One thing to be wary about is that sometimes smaller banks can offer competitive rates that are slightly higher than more established banks. My advice is to just go with banks that are well-established and part of the FDIC, so in case something catastrophic happens, you won't have to worry about the bank not being able to give your money back.

## Certificate of Deposit (CD)

A CD is an agreement to put your money in a bank without taking it out, and receiving some return on it. In this contract, you are taking a risk as an investor in that you won't take your money out of the bank, but the bank is also taking a risk in that even if they want to use your money, they have to promise to return you the amount specified on the contract. Because of this non-liquid nature of this investment, it's typically a little bit higher returns than a savings account. Of course, you really have to commit to it, but this is a great option if you have a lot of money as youngster and you know you won't be spending the money anytime soon anyway. If you are going to put a ton of money in a savings account and keep it there long term anyway, a CD is a great option.

## Roth IRA

If you're young and you make _some_ sort of income, try to throw _as much_ money as you can into your Roth IRA. The ROTH IRA is essentially a mutual fund, kind of like a [401k](./chap2.md) Retirement Fund, where your money is invested by a professional brokerage, and has potential to grow in value over time, and the major purpose of the investment is to serve as a source of money during retirement, when you don't work anymore.

I know there are people who say "ROTH IRA is a waste of your money" What they mean is that the ROTH IRA grows too slowly, and doesn't let you access it until you retire. But hey, this is the `free money` section, so I'm only going to talk about risk-free actions.

The greatest part about the ROTH IRA is that it's an investment you __don't have to pay taxes on__. This comes with a caveat, and that is you are contributing to your ROTH IRA with your after tax money. But this is still a very strong perk, because for almost any money-making method, the money you make is taxable. Unless you take your money out early, which you have to pay a penalty the money you make from ROTH IRA is yours to keep. Even retirements funds like the 401k are taxed when you withdraw from it.
